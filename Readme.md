Weater-Dashboard 

The purpose of this project is to develop a weather dashboard app that will be utilized by traveler. The traveler will be able to search for a city and will be able to view the date, the name of the city and icon representation of current and future weather conditions including temperature, humidity and wind-speed for that specific city.  The city will be added to the search history and will be stored in local-storage.
